Users changes. You agree to notify us immediately of additional license 
requirements if the number of Developer Users increases. Zetetic reserves the right 
to adjust per-developer pricing at any time.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement and payment in full of fees due, we hereby 
grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to:

that the original and any copies are kept in your possession and that your use of the 
Software does not exceed the license grant. 

Trial License Grant

We may, at our discretion, make the Software available on a free trial basis for the 
purpose of evaluating the Software before purchasing paid licenses. Subject to the

limited license to use the Software for internal development and evaluation 
purposes in a single program or application for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) 
calendar days. You are explicitly prohibited from redistributing the Software,

accordance with section 10 upon completion of the trial period.

Warranty

The Software itself is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We further 
disclaim any and all implied warranties or conditions, including any implied 
warranty of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular 
purpose, regardless of whether we know or had reason to know of your particular 
needs. No employee, agent, dealer or distributor of ours is authorized to modify this 
limited warranty, nor to make any additional warranties.

Limited Remedy

In no event will we be liable to you for any damages, including any lost profits, lost 
revenue, lost savings, lost data or data use, or other incidental, special, punitive or 
consequential damages arising from the use of, or the inability to use, the Software 
(even if we or an authorized dealer or distributor has been advised of the possibility

amount you paid to us for your license to use the Software. You shall indemnify us

licenses and are not considered part of our Software for the purposes of this 
Agreement. Your rights and obligations for such components are defined by the 
applicable software license. By using the Software you are responsible for 
compliance with the terms of all Third Party component licenses, including 
requirements for acknowledgement, copyright statements, or limitations on 
distribution. A list of Third Party components and licenses is available upon request 
or by visiting http://sqlcipher.net/license.

Support and Maintenance
 
We will not be responsible for providing technical support or Software updates 
under this agreement, except through a Support Subscription.

You must purchase one Support Subscription per Platform for each Developer User 
of the Software, and promptly purchase additional subscriptions if the number of 
Developer Users changes. All licensed Developer Users must have an active Support 
Subscription in order for any Developer Users to make use of the benefits. You agree 
to notify us immediately of additional subscription requirements if the number of 
Developer Users increases. Zetetic reserves the right to adjust per-developer 
subscription pricing at any time.

A Support Subscription, and payment of associated annual recurring fees, will 
entitle licensed Developer Users to receive the following benefits during the 
subscription term:

1.	Direct private Support from us via email, including:
a.	Technical inquiries
b.	Implementation guidance
c.	Troubleshooting
d.	Defect remediation
2.	Software updates upon request at no additional cost 

All support requests will be conducted privately and confidentially, unless they are 
made public with your permission. We will handle and treat such support requests 
with higher priority, as compared to comparable requests made via public channels.

Before contacting us, you will work to resolve the problem if it is not clearly related 
to a defect in the Software. Such efforts may include basic installation, basic 
configuration, basic usage support, ongoing maintenance, problem isolation and any 
investigation to define, isolate, reproduce and resolve problems. 

Support requests will be initiated by contacting support@zetetic.net or 
http://zetetic.net/contact. Email communications can be secured using PGP/GPG 
upon request. 

We will acknowledge and respond to support communications once they are 
received. Initial response times will vary based on factors including the time the 
request is initiated, the severity of the reported issue, and availability of support 
resources, so we do not guarantee a speciﬁc response time. Upon acknowledgement 
of an issue, we will provide assistance with the identification and remediation of 
issues in the Software. We will use reasonable efforts to provide Support for the 
Software, subject to the following limitations:

1.	A Support Subscription does not create or imply any additional warranty for 
the Software. We remain the owner of all right, title and interest in the 
Software, intellectual property, related written materials, communications 
and code developed by us during the support term. 
2.	We may at our sole discretion provide guidance on application 
implementation, integration and design, but will not be responsible for 
development of application code.
3.	We will provide assistance with the identiﬁcation and remediation of issues 
in the Software; however, we do not guarantee the resolution of issues 
reported under a Support Subscription. 
4.	We reserve the right to limit total Support time expended under related to 
issues raised by your Developer Users across all Support Subscriptions to a 
total of fifteen (15) hours within each annual term. Issues related to the 
Software that we independently identify will not contribute to this limit.
5.	We reserve the right to limit or preclude at our sole discretion our out-of-
pocket costs for providing support.
6.	Under no circumstances will we be responsible for providing technical 
support to users of your software or any third party.

Documentation in your possession and notifying us of your termination.

from the effective date and will automatically renew each year on the anniversary of 
the effective date unless either party provides written notice at least 30 days prior

If you breach this Agreement or otherwise fail to comply with any term or condition 
we may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to you. We further reserve

Agreement, abuse of the Software, or non-payment, you will not be entitled to any 
refund of amounts paid.
